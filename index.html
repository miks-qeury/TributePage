		<h2>Soviet ideologization</h2>
		<p>After his death, Pavlov was transformed into a symbol of Soviet science, his scientific exploit was also considered as an ideological feat (in some sense the "Pavlov school" (or Pavlov's teaching) became an ideological phenomenon). Under the slogan "Protection of the Pavlovian Heritage", the so-called "Pavlov Session" of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences (organizers - KM Bykov, A. G. Ivanov-Smolensky) was held in 1950, where the leading physiologists of the country were persecuted. Such a policy, however, was in sharp contradiction with Pavlov's own views</p>
